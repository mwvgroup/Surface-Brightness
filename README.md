# Surface-Brightness
Surface Brightness Calculations

This script uses input values from the file 'GALEX flux.csv' to determine the surface brightness of a supernova's local enviornment. The input file contains the redshift of each enviornment along with the exposure time and average counts per second.For some cases there was no available redshift for a supernovaâ€™s host environment. In these cases redshift values of the supernova itself were used. These cases include:

Some points that still need to be resolved:

SN2014dk had two recorded redshift values 0.038; 0.02.

There were two supernova iPTFdkj, and iPTFdkx in the GALEX file that were not present in the redshift file. I took these as typos for iPTF13dkj, and iPTF13dkx, but have not verified this assumption yet.
